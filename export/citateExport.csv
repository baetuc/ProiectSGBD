191,Technology is dominated by two types of people: Those who understand what they do not manage. Those who manage what they do not understand.,Putt's Law.
192,Ugly programs are like ugly suspension bridges: they're much more liable to collapse than pretty ones because the way humans (especially engineer-humans) perceive beauty is intimately related to our ability to process and understand complexity. A language that makes it hard to write elegant code makes it hard to write good code.,Eric S. Raymond.
193,PHP is a minor evil perpetrated and created by incompetent amateurs whereas Perl is a great and insidious evil perpetrated by skilled but perverted professionals.,Jon Ribbens.

522,When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European or anything else you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent?
